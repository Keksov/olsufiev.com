<br />
<tt>Dear Victor.</tt><br />
<tt>I had a look at the bibliography you put together and it seems
quite</tt><br />
<tt>impressive, nevertheless it may be difficult to bring together
all</tt><br />
<tt>the references to what Shah has written. Since you include
references</tt><br />
<tt>to items not published by Octagon Press, let me add a few: I'm
mostly</tt><br />
<tt>familiar with the Spanish speaking area, and there you could
find a</tt><br />
<tt>book like "Sufismo en Occidente", a very interesting work,
since its</tt><br />
<tt>authorship is anonymous, but includes the article The Teaching
Story</tt><br />
<tt>by Idries Shah (although without acknowledgement of
authorship), the</tt><br />
<tt>article goes on and on (beyond the English version/original)
and</tt><br />
<tt>becomes the founding stone for a book which interplays
traditional</tt><br />
<tt>teaching stories and explanations of its use or aim within
the</tt><br />
<tt>context of sufi work, and a few things beside...</tt><br />
<tt>I say the book is interesting because it is used as initial
reading</tt><br />
<tt>for Spanish speaking students of Omar Ali Shah, when they try
to get</tt><br />
<tt>involved in Agha's work. So you have a book written by
Shah</tt><br />
<tt>(anonymously) used as a basic text book by Omar Ali Shah. For
all</tt><br />
<tt>those people who for years have been trying to work out
the</tt><br />
<tt>differences and split between the two brothers it may almost be
a</tt><br />
<tt>shock.</tt><br />
<tt>Another text originally published in Argentina in early
seventies</tt><br />
<tt>is "Textos Sufis". It includes a couple of articles you could
find</tt><br />
<tt>in "The Diffusion .....", although with a different length
or</tt><br />
<tt>details, besides many other articles not found in the English
books</tt><br />
<tt>I'm may be familiar with or you mention in the
bibliography.</tt><br />
<tt>I'm not trying to play at: "I do have information you don't",
Shah</tt><br />
<tt>and his school have been disseminating materials in
different</tt><br />
<tt>cultures and at different time scale. If you were to meet
somebody</tt><br />
<tt>from the Turkish speaking area or the Arabic one, he could
probably</tt><br />
<tt>point out materials in his/her own cultural area related to
Shah's</tt><br />
<tt>school not available elsewhere. At the same time materials
of</tt><br />
<tt>internal diffusion within the Shah circles may have not been
released.</tt><br />
<tt>Since you seem to have a Russian background you may be
interested to</tt><br />
<tt>know there was a book published by Shah in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan, in</tt><br />
<tt>1993, the title is "Order of Nakshbandi", and as far as I know
is a</tt><br />
<tt>tri-lingual English, Russian and Uzbek abridgement of his
writings,</tt><br />
<tt>how this book can be tailored and have specific relevance
to</tt><br />
<tt>Uzbek/Russian people I do not know. But that far could the
story go...</tt><br />
<br />
<tt>I had a look months ago to the files of Mushkil Gusha
and</tt><br />
<tt>Caravanserai to see the contributions different people have
made, a</tt><br />
<tt>very interesting one -personal taste is almost always peculiar-
was a</tt><br />
<tt>series of lengthy contributions by Bruce Main-Smith, a pupil of
Shah</tt><br />
<tt>in the 60-70's. Besides a fresh down to earth account, he
mentioned</tt><br />
<tt>the division sufis hold of different climates or cultural areas
and</tt><br />
<tt>that people shouldn't jump from one to another. I've heard the
same</tt><br />
<tt>principle several times and it may account for a lot of
differences</tt><br />
<tt>in the public projection (writings included).</tt><br />
<br />
<tt>You will excuse me -I hope- if I have been fiddling around
and</tt><br />
<tt>spoiled a little bit the concept of a full Shah's bibliography,
but</tt><br />
<tt>the "riddle within an enigma" of the sufi teaching is something
I do</tt><br />
<tt>not want to suffer in silence.</tt><br />
<br />
<tt>Warmest Regards.</tt><br />
<tt>Francisco</tt></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c4'>Extensive quotes from 8 of
Shah's books. See below. Introduction acknowledges Shah's work:
"The Sufis assert that the present diffusion of this teaching is
due to humanity's current need for normal development. To quote
Idries Shah, the greatest living authority on</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c4'>Sufism, he is interested in
making available in the West those aspects of Sufism that will be
of use to the West." He then footnotes with a reference to Shah's
family. The book is only 80 pages but impressive in its command of
both Shah's and Borges' published works. (Let me<br />
know if you would like to borrow it)<br />
