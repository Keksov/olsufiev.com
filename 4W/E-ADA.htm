<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c8' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c8' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of a Sufi teacher is multi-faceted.
One part of his functions may be known, another sometimes can be
guessed, while yet another one is hidden.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c8' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c8' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; What is usually discussed is the most
explicit, “social” part of a teacher’s work: communication,
mentoring, conducting meetings, exercises. All this can also be
done by an imitator.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c8' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c10'>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the less
known (yet widely practiced) functions of a teacher is helping a
student via a direct impact.&nbsp; During such an impact the
teacher establishes a direct exchange, circulation of energy
between his and the student’s “common presences”. During this
process the student receives the most valuable possession of the
teacher: his “higher hydrogens”, a part of his soul. These higher
energies, filling in the intervals of the corresponding octaves,
play the role of “shocks” (in Gurdjieff’s terminology) which allow
a further development of certain processes in the student’s common
presence. This results in a</span> <span class='c1'>“purification”
of the student, his ascent (even if a small one) to a higher stage.
(<b><span class='c11'>*2</span></b>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time
the teacher extract from the student’s common presence the “dirt”
which was contained in the corresponding parts of the centers. The
teacher sho<span class='c3'>uld be strong enough in order not to
stain himself with this “dirt”. His task is to transform,
transubstantiate these lower hydrogens obtained by him, into the
higher ones. Otherwise the same may happen to him that happens to a
person who is trying to lift a stone which is too heavy: not only
he will not lift the stone, but he will also</span> strain himself
(<b><span class='c11'>*3</span></b>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no
general recipes here: the teacher should have a precise knowledge
of the student’s condition, type, strategy and tactics of his
development (<b><span class='c11'>*4</span></b>), as well as
calculate correctly his own efforts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c10'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the
language of Christianity, the teacher takes upon himself the “sins”
of the student. By approaching (even if temporarily) the level of
the student, the teacher sacrifices the highest thing he has: his
own further development, his salvation. Compared to this, a
sacrifice of one’s health, even life, may be considered as
inferior. The higher the teacher, the greater the sacrifice. This
is why Christ’s sacrifice is sometimes called cosmic.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; In some sense
this action can be compared with sucking the venom out of a person
bitten by a snake. But woe is upon him who at the same time has a
sore in his mouth …</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; A particular
case of such influence (directed at the physical body) is provided
by the so-called “sorcerer’s” healing. During the process the
healer provides the patient with his own energy directing it to the
weakened organ. A precise “seeing” of the illness and a fast and
complete restoration of the healer’s energy serve as an indication
of his power. (<b><span class='c11'>*5</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the
teacher establishes a contact with the student for <span class=
'c3'>transmitting spirituality to the latter on a deeper, finer
level. This is their real, invisible and secret link. Through this
“thread”,</span> as through umbilical cord, the student eventually
becomes capable of receiving help (<span class='c3'>power,
blessing, baraka</span>) from the teacher of his teacher and so
on&nbsp; (<b><span class='c11'>*6</span></b>). Given a certain
degree of crystallization of the student’s astral body, this
connection is preserved after the physical death of his teacher.
Thus, at a certain stage of his development the seeker is included
into a “chain” or “net” of his real brothers and sisters in order
to complete a common task, which is a conscious realization of the
meaning of his life. (<b><span class=
'c11'>*7</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c12' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US" class='c12' xml:lang=
"EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; This link is higher than blood kinship. Blood
also contains higher hydrogens through which a connection is
maintained, but the spiritual connection described above is
conscious, and it carries the influences of a higher and more
“refined” nature. (<b><span class='c11'>*8</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; One Hasidic
teacher has said that a teacher cannot just pull a student out of
the mud by simply extending his hand from above. No, he will have
to descend into the mud himself to help the student …</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Offering this
(as any other) sacrifice, a Sufi, be it a teacher or otherwise,
does it with joy. By this he expresses his gratitude to the Source
of his knowledge which has given a meaning and purpose to his life.
Of course, only God is the giver of all blessings. But, being
<span class='c3'>insufficiently perfect to behold God,</span> the
seeker expresses his gratitude through service. This is what is
meant by his debt of Love. (<b><span class=
'c11'>*9</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
understanding <span class='c3'>acquired on the Path serves</span>
as a source to the generosity of soul which characterizes the
Sufis. The development of this quality, which is necessary for a
seeker, starts with generosity in a usual, worldly sense. This is
why so many Sufi stories (including “Arabian Nights”) praise this
quality. (<b><span class='c13'>*10</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; With time,
acquiring a better and better understanding of his place in the
general process, the student, in his turn, cannot help but feel a
deep gratitude to his teacher as a source of his growth, and a
stronger and stronger desire to pay his debt of Love. <span class=
'c3'>However,</span> not necessarily by teaching others.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c10'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by virtue
of Love, a living</span> <span class='c1'>esoteric Tradition is
preserved in the course of centuries and even millennia. “There is
a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love,
the only survival, the only meaning.” (<b><span class=
'c11'>*11</span></b>).</span></p>
