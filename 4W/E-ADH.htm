"EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">Gurdjieff had mentioned <span class='c10'>the shortcomings
of ordinary</span> language many times. In the ordinary
<span class='c10'>world of ‘Confusion of Languages’,</span> many
facts - especially those relating to the “subtler” aspects of being
- are difficult to express correctly. So he used the language of
the System: in particular, the idea of “Universal Scale” – the
“Table of Hydrogens”, showing the place of all events in the cosmic
hierarchy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c11' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c11' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">The essence is material, but its materiality is subtle. It
cannot be observed when researching the body or with scientific
tools, since the subtlest hydrogen accessible to the sensory organs
is hydrogen H192.&nbsp; Even hydrogen H96 (<i>hanbledzoin</i>, life
force, etc.) is rarely perceived by humans. The qualities stored in
the essence are like ‘computer programs’ or ‘codes’. They are
material as well. Due to their ‘subtlety’ and ‘high concentration
of information’ they can be transmitted, in particular genetically.
Thus, for example, creative abilities are stored in the essence as
‘subtle energy’, ‘codes’ and they can be inherited; although, in
order to actualize they should be developed. For example, a child
of a famous composer evacuated, let’s say, to the steppes of
Kazakhstan [during war time] might never actually develop
his</span> <span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang="EN-CA">musical
talent. But he would certainly be attracted to music, even
there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">So it is natural that people at the higher levels of being
whose higher centers are activated (and those centers are known to
use the subtler hydrogens) are able to perceive thinner substances
and manipulate them (send, receive, direct, etc.) In particular,
<i>baraka</i> is transmitted in this way. For an ordinary,
‘two-dimensional’ person, who lives on the surface of his so-called
‘conscience’ these abilities seem ‘supernatural’ or even
incredible. In the Soviet media, years were spent on dumb
discussions about the impossibility of extrasensory abilities
(professor Kitaigorodskii), even though a simple gypsy woman needs
just one minute to prove their existence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>By the way, gypsies are the
only nation known to me (of those living in Europe), whose
so-called ‘extrasensory’ abilities are transmitted genetically
<i>en masse</i>. It can be said that they are ‘represented’ on our
planet as a kind of collective ‘safe keepers’ of certain qualities.
Almost all <span class='c10'>gypsies (sometimes even the ‘degraded’
ones) possess a number of unusual abilities, such as seeing the
past and foreseeing the future, etc., even though the extent to
which these qualities are developed, varies from person to person.
Since in the conscious spiritual development gypsies are failing as
badly as all other people, they are merely unconscious safe</span>
keepers. (<b><span class='c12'>*1</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>One more example of the
genetic transmission of special abilities (although not on a
nation-wide scale<span class='c10'>) is the institute of
<i>sayyids</i>. Its degradation happened a long time ago, so it
seems that already in the time of Rumi, the <i>sayyids</i> had been
treated skeptically (</span><b><span class=
'c12'>*2</span></b><span class='c10'>). And although the potential
of the special, unique qualities is still being transferred to the
direct descendants of the Prophet (Peace be upon him!), only a
small percentage of the descendants actually realize this
potential. Others live and die like ordinary
people…</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" class='c9' xml:lang=
"EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c13'>The ‘program’ located in
the human essence, gives a predisposition to manifest, say, the
creative abilities (if these abilities are developed) and
essentially performs the function of a ‘relay’ directing the higher
hydrogens to the higher parts of the Emotional and Intellectual
centers and thus ‘turning on’ the HEC [High Emotional Center]. In a
human organism, there is always some quantity of hydrogen H12
produced as the result of its machine’s work. This ‘surplus’
(unless the astral body is going through its crystallization
process) can be spent in various ways. With some people, it can
‘automatically’ be directed to the highest parts of the centers and
the HEC. This phenomenon (‘inspiration’) allows them to create
masterpieces of literature and art, compose fine music, make
important discoveries, etc. Then the circuit breaks and the talent
or genius becomes an ordinary person…. until the next burst of
inspiration. (</span><b><span class='c14'>*3</span></b><span class=
'c13'>) Biographers are often astounded by the mismatch of the
genius’s creative work and his mediocre character, life style, etc.
Quite often he is the same mechanical person as others. As Plato
wrote, a poet is like a drainpipe through which the gods pour out
the beautiful. Hence it is said the talent comes from God. A person
does not possess it, he can only be fortunate enough to express and
capture a part of the Divine harmony (</span><b><span class=
'c14'>*4</span></b><span class='c13'>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c13'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c13'>It’s quite a different
matter when creative abilities are related to the conscious
development of essence. An example of this is a pleiad of genial
Sufi poets. In such a case the human development harmonizes with
the talent development. Having the opportunity to manage the
inspiration, direct it (to various extents, of course) people like
these are able to create pieces of ‘objective art’ or such pieces
more or less approaching it. Therefore, this type masterpieces
usually have several layers of meaning, consciously embedded (or,
one could say, passed down from the higher source’, reflected) by
their compilers. The key is the creator’s <b>understanding</b> of
his creation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>Through the Perfected
Human, Messenger (i.e. the o<span class='c10'>ne with a</span>
harmonized and completely developed essence) it is possible to
transmit real objective art, reflecting the Divine harmony and
cosmic laws to the maximum of human ability. In writing, this
transmission constitutes the Sacred Scripts. That is why every
letter in the Torah or the Koran is considered sacred.
Traditionally, they are considered to have seven (the octave)
layers of meaning. It is known that in order to avoid distortions
of the Scripts, the profession of copying the Torah and the Koran
has been very important in both religious traditions
(<b><span class='c12'>*5</span></b>).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>Since the creative
abilities depend on the availability and the correct supply of
certain energies (Hydrogens) to the centers, it is natural that
such abilities can develop in a person on the Path unexpectedly
(for this person), even though they had never appeared before and
had not been transmitted genetically. It can happen as the result
of certain exercises or due to the will (‘grace’) of the teacher
enabling such ‘plugging in’ of the disciple’s energy (or the
teacher’s own).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>This is one aspect of the
Sufi’s ‘wine’ in action… (<b><span class=
'c12'>*6</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>On the color of essence
(<b><span class='c12'>*7</span></b>). As happens with other
abilities, there are some ordinary people possessing the inborn
gift to perceive the color of essence, regardless of the extent to
which they actually recognize this ability by their usual,
so-called ‘awakened’ mind. These people have the ability to select
the best color of clothes (for themselves and others) with an
amazing precision.&nbsp; Often, having discovered this quality in
themselves, such people use it professionally.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span class='c14'>*1</span></b>
<span class='c18'>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same fashion, the Jewish
nation <span class="c17">is</span> still represents an unconscious
‘safe keeper’ of the universal cosmic law, inscribed in the Torah,
even though it does not make the Jews neither wiser, nor more
conscious nor, quite understandably, happier than others (although
some ‘safe keeping’ qualities in Jews are transmitted</span>
<span class='c1'>genetically and some via the tradition). Not
accidentally, Hitler made it his goal to <span class=
'c10'>exterminate head</span> by head exactly those two nations:
the Jews and the Gypsies. <span class='c10'>Similarly, after the
[Russian] revolution, the Bolsheviks intentionally tried to destroy
the whole nobility class, ‘the blue blood’, as</span> the keepers
of the best qualities in the Russian genetic pool.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>Or, for example, the same
[Bolsheviks] strived to find and destroy Sufi sheikhs in Central
Asia. I myself had a chance to witness that the memories about this
are still alive in those places. The same thing <span class=
'c10'>the Soviet bastards tried to do (already in ‘our’ time) when
committing outrages on the sacred land of Afghanistan.&nbsp; The
art of destruction, since the earliest times, has been mastered by
people much better than the art of creation …</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c1'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span class=
'c14'>*2</span></b><span class='c1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; See Rumi’s story
about the gardener [or the garden owner, depending on the
translation]. By the way, one of the interpretations: the Sufi, the
Sayyid, and the Theologian, who came to the garden, are three
centers in a person – emotional, instinctive, and
intellectual.</span></p>

<span class='c18'>Since my early years, I enjoyed the work of the
Strugatski brothers (and am enjoying it now). Sometimes almost
‘prophetic’ ideas can be found in their books. Many years ago, in
some magazine I read a long interview with them and was strongly
disappointed by their views and way of thinking, which contrasted
so much with their books. Another example. I once attended a
performance by Esambaev. This person’s talent (or genius) in
dancing has always stricken me. After the performance he gave a
speech. What a handicap in both content and form! Let him rather
dance….&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span class=
'c14'>*5</span></b><span class='c13'>&nbsp; In this way, the Torah
is the Law not only in the sense usually implied, i.e. religious
and social. The Torah <b>is</b> the Law since the Cosmic Law is
inscribed in it. The esoteric tradition considers the Torah, as a
piece of objective art, to have recorded all the past, present and
future life of humankind. Not accidentally, all three religions of
the “People of the Book” - Judaism, Christianity and Islam – treat
the Torah with such respect.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class='c13'>The Lord Himself says:
“For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass</span>
<span class='c1'>away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the
law until all is accomplished.” (Matthew 5:18) Nowadays attempts
are made to decipher the Torah using computers. See <i>Drosnin,
