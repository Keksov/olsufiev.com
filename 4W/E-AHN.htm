<p class="MsoNormal c16"><span class='c5'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c16"><span class='c5'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; I don’t know if there
are any keys for perceiving <i>any</i> or <i>most</i> of the
parables published by Idries Shah, and I don’t remember coming
across any explanations of such keys or even references to their
existence. Moreover, I have my doubts whether such keys (if I have
understood correctly what you have written), exist. Why do I think
so?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; First of all, because
the tendency to simply consider the stories within the scope or
within the context of something, arises from the work of the
<span class="c18">mind</span>. By limiting ourselves in this way,
we cut ourselves off from that part of the message which a
particular story can carry for other parts of what Gurdjieff used
to <span class='c8'>call “our common presence” (whether</span> we
know about it or not).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; It seems to me, it
would be too easy: apply one of the interpretations of this sort
and, as if by magic, the door will open. There are many stories and
parables which do allow application of more or less simple decoding
methods: these are allegorical stories. By taking them in an
appropriate context, or layer, it is possible to uncover the
meaning of their content, and to interpret it accordingly. However,
Sufi teaching stories are not allegories. And if they are, they are
<span class="c18">not only</span> allegories.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Of course, many of
the Sufi stories may be interpreted as being related to
psychological processes. That is a valid consideration which is
even useful for developing one’s understanding. But even if a story
is interpreted in a psychological sense, this does not mean that
its meaning is exhausted by that. It may contain a great deal
more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Idries Shah himself
wrote that <b>Sufi teaching stories are works of objective art</b>
which are used to transmit (or, more exactly,&nbsp;can be used to
transmit - given the right place, time and a prepared person), the
Higher Knowledge. We cannot perceive this Higher Knowledge because
we are not prepared for it. Moreover, we don’t know what it is, and
often don’t even suspect its presence. Such a preparation can be
helped by not only getting to know the stories but also by studying
them and <span class="c18">familiarizing</span> (<b><span class=
'c19'>*01</span></b><span class='c8'>) with them. In the light of
this, even though considering stories as allegories (whenever it
can be done) constitutes a “lower” level of understanding, it can
still be a useful method. The same applies to interpreting stories
as relating to states of mind.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;The problem, as Shah
points out, is that if a person has “understood” (in his or her
opinion) a story, then he has understood it only at the level where
he stands at present moment (which, naturally, may be not so high).
More precisely, <b>he understands the story at the level of his
conditioning</b>. If the person decides that “this is the meaning”,
it is as if internally he considers the problem closed and
therefore he can cut off the chance of further, deeper impact of
the story on his “inner being”. Here is, by the way, one more
example of interpretation of a famous story “The blind people and
the elephant” or “The Elephant in the Dark” by Sanai and Rumi – our
different parts or our “selves” sensing the higher, unusual&nbsp;
and inexplicable [teaching] material in the blindness or in the
darkness of our “consciousness”…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp; After multiple
readings the teaching stories not only stick to one’s memory but as
if “seep in”. The result of their impact can manifest itself after
a long time (<b><span class='c19'>*02</span></b>) and in a manner
quite different from what we associate with “understanding”. For
example, the manifestation can be a certain nonstandard reaction in
a right (time, place, and people) situation. Stories also carry the
teaching in such a form that we can learn by adopting and absorbing
the experience directly, without participation of our mechanical
mind (<b><span class='c19'>*03</span></b>). By allowing our lower,
logical mind to deal with teaching stories in a way which is
customary to it, and considering the result of this as
“<span class='c8'>understanding”, we can find ourselves in a
situation of a boy who had dismembered a fly into its components
and then wondered where the fly itself went. (One of the favorite
stories of Idries Shah).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of
the Sufi teaching stories, as well as other works of “objective
art”, is the Cosmic Laws. Knowledge of these laws is the highest
knowledge available to a human, since the laws of “our” Universe
are the laws of our “description of the world”. Whichever form is
used to transmit the true Knowledge, its essence stays the same
(</span><b><span class='c21'>*04</span></b><span class=
'c22'>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories
contain in their inner structure (often invisible) fragments of
these higher Laws (</span><b><span class=
'c21'>*05</span></b><span class='c22'>). We don’t have an
instrument for real understanding of even these fragments (more
precisely, we do have it, but it is undeveloped). Teaching stories
are designed to develop this organ or organs. In which way? By
“tuning” into the Laws. Penetrating inside the essence of a person,
the special knowledge produces a kind of harmonization of the inner
world of the student, “attuning” it to the consonance with the
Infinite. This feeds the embryo of our “inner being”, our real
“Self”, our soul. That explains why an impact on the mind and the
feelings only, is not enough: one should give the higher energy an
opportunity to penetrate deeper.&nbsp; Of course, this applies not
only to stories, but also other types of teaching. To quote Rafael
Lefort (“<a href="Images/Lefort.jpg">The Teachers of
Gurdjieff</a>”):</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c23'>&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘How were the
texts studied?’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘By constant reading so that the different levels of
meaning should be absorbed gradually.&nbsp; They were not read to
be “understood” as you understand the term but to be absorbed into
the very texture of your conscious being and your inner self.&nbsp;
In the west the intellectual teaches that you must understand a
thing to profit from it.&nbsp; Sufi lore places no reliance upon
such a clumsy thing as your superficial ability. The baraka seeps
in, often despite you, rather than being forced to wait upon the
doorstep until your “intellect” permits it to filter through in an
attenuated form.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;&nbsp; How much
“power” a Sufi story has depends on how “high” are the Laws it is
intended to transmit. From an outward point of view (literary,
psychological, etc.) it is impossible to determine the precise
content of a story, the “power” contained in it.
(</span><b><span class='c21'>*06</span></b><span class=
'c22'>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c20'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Often the power
contained in a particular story is indicated by the number of its
possible interpretations. Gurdjieff mentioned that the Gospels are
works of objective art. This explains their charming influence on
the people for the past two thousand years.&nbsp; Until our days
the stories of the Scripture are repeated, commented upon,
interpreted, and used as a source of inspiration. And this is not
surprising. Being a creation of a higher consciousness the stories
of the Gospels contain in their hidden essence the structure of the
same laws on which the Universe is built. For example, the famous
parable of the talents can be interpreted on the level of
psychology, applied to the spiritual development of a person, a
school and so on. The same story can be interpreted in the context
of the physical laws of the Universe. Why? Because it describes a
certain more general law which permeates all spheres.
(</span><b><span class='c24'>*07</span></b><span class='c22'>).
(This returns us to your question on “keys”).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceiving one
(or even more than one) aspect of the story, we may not see that it
contains different aspects and level coexisting harmoniously in it.
A developed person, who understands teaching stories in full and
“sees” the meaning and the laws contained in the stories, can
organize them in such a manner, that not only one but a group of
stories will bring the necessary influence. Naturally, the task
gets more complicated when the method used is that of “scattering”
the ideas, disseminating [seeds]”, e.g. when the method uses, in
Gurdjieff’s terminology, “B influences”. In this case, the matter
in question is books and their influence on wide audience over the
long-term period. Since Idries Shah used compilation and writing of
books as one of the basic methods of transmitting Knowledge
(<b><span class='c19'>*08</span></b>),&nbsp; he aligned stories in
a particular sequence in order to ensure the necessary and
maximally optimal impact of the Knowledge contained in them, on the
consciousness of various groups of readers. It is this aspect, in
my view, which explains Shah’s recommendation, repeated many times,
to read each book from its beginning to its end, and not
selectively. This should be done regardless of the fact, whether
the stories appeal to us or otherwise, whether we remember them or
not, “understand” them or not and so on. Here are some quotes from
Shah:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>Selective reading, following
only the things which one decides are interesting or central to
Sufi – or any other kind of – knowledge, can produce ludicrous
results, if it does anything at all. This has been called ‘making a
comb without the teeth’. I rather like one story intended to help
the learner register the need to attend to all aspects of a
teaching story, or of instructions given by an authentic teacher,
or even procedures handed down (</span><b><span class=
'c21'>*09</span></b><span class='c5'>)&nbsp; from
antiquity:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class=
'c5'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE HONEYMOON</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp; A man was seen,
dressed in exotic finery, whooping it up in the streets of a city.
Someone asked him why he was doing it. “Why not?” he asked, “I
<i>am</i> on my honeymoon!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp; “But where is your
bride?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp; “Oh, she’s been here
once before, so she stayed at home!” (</span><b><span class=
'c25'>*10</span></b><span class='c5'>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c5'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>And also:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c26'>&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn
something, you may have often to be exposed to it many times,
perhaps from different perspectives; and you also have to give it
the kind of attention which will enable you to learn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c26'>&nbsp;&nbsp; In our
experience, people fail to learn from Sufi materials for the same
reason that they do not learn other things – they read
selectively.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c26'>&nbsp;&nbsp; The things that
touch them emotionally, or which they like or are thrilled by, they
will remember or seek in greater quantity and depth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c26'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since these are
often the last materials which they will probably need, and since
such an unbalanced attitude towards anything makes the person in
need of balance in his approach, we have situation to which you
refer.</span><span class='c27'>&nbsp;</span> <span class=
'c24'>(*<b>16</b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c29'>And more:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c29'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c26'>&nbsp;&nbsp; A Sufi book
will have to be read in the ordinary way several times. If the mind
of the reader is not correctly prepared, he will reject the book,
read it selectively, or else indoctrinate himself with the
contents. All these results are undesirable.</span> <span class=
'c21'>(*<b>18</b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure an
impact of teaching stories on people, which would be so important
in content, wide in scope and long-lasting, one needs to understand
deeply the essence of this type of objective art, to know the
psychology of modern people and to see clearly the goal of the Work
(<b><span class='c19'>*11</span></b>). I have no means of judging
whether or not Idries Shah was the Teacher of the Age, as it is
frequently claimed (if would <span class='c8'>be preposterous of me
to try to make any conclusions on the matter not to mention that
there may be different interpretations of this term), but the
gigantic work carried out by him is</span> unparalleled in our
time. This work by itself is also a product of objective art, and
it couldn’t be otherwise (<b><span class=
'c19'>*12</span></b>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in
order to expose oneself correctly to the higher influences
conducted by Sufi stories, one should try to follow the
recommendations given by the author-compiler himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; If one tries to
formulate the practical advices or rules of working with Sufi
stories, recommended by Shah, then the following can be mentioned:
(<b><span class='c19'>*13</span></b>)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c29'>1. Every book should be read
from its beginning to its end, and not selectively.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c29'>2. Read not just</span>
<span class='c30'>once, but <b>several times</b>, to memorize the
stories better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>3. When reflecting about
Sufi stories, discussing them (<b><span class=
'c19'>*14</span></b><span class='c8'>)</span>, interpreting them on
different levels, trying to understand them, it is important not to
consider any of the understandings, no matter&nbsp; how significant
a “discovery” it may seem, as the <b>final</b> and only truth. One
should always leave the possibility of another interpretation,
another understanding, which may turn out to be a discovery of no
smaller, and perhaps greater, importance and depth, even if is not
always formulated (and maybe not always perceived consciously). In
short, one should remain “open” to the <i>baraka</i> carried by
these stories.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to give
another, personal, recommendation: read Shah in English
(<b><span class='c19'>*15</span></b>). Translations can be better
or worse but a part of the meaning (energy, influence) is
unavoidably lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; This message
does not pretend to be an attempt to cover teaching stories from
all, or many, sides (I am definitely unequal to such a task). I
have simply tried to give an answer to the question according to my
understanding of the subject matter, mostly using the material

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*01</span></b>
<span class='c17'>&nbsp;”<span class="c18">Familiarize
yourself</span>” is an expression used repeatedly by Shah in
connection with the study of Sufi stories. (The original Russian
comment emphasizes “familiarizing” in the sense of “becoming
akin”). “</span><span class='c5'>Groups for the intensive study of
this and other material proceed by a thorough familiarization with
the contents of these writings: the student is asked to 'soak'
himself in them, as rain soaks into the earth.”</span> <span class=
'c17'>(“<i><a href="Images/ShahDif.jpg">The Diffusion
of Sufi Ideas in the West</a></i>”)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c29'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, this
requires a special attitude to the material. This is why, when
speaking about his books, Idries Shah mentions
“…</span><span class='c26'>asking interested people to read them
carefully</span><span class='c29'>”&nbsp; (“<i><a href="Images/ShahLearn.jpg">Learning How
To Learn</a>”</i>, chapter “Thinking in Terms of
Supply-and-Demand”)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*02</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; The <span class=
'c8'>patient needs <i>time</i></span>, as well as pomegranates (A
story about pomegranates known to the readers of Shah)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*03</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Rumi’s story about a
merchant and a bird which pretended to be dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*04</span></b>
<span class='c17'>&nbsp;It is the knowledge of the basic laws of
Cosmos which allows applying them to completely different areas.
Many stories about sages mention their intuitive ability to deal
correctly with the matters of which they knew very little (or
nothing at all). This is another aspect of
“seeing”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*05</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp;This is what Shah calls
<i>inner dimensions</i>. <span class='c8'>See the article</span>
<a href="/4W/E-ADR.htm"><span >On dimensions</span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*06</span></b>
<span class='c17'>&nbsp;For example, why “The Story of Mushkil
Gusha” from “<i><a href="Images/ShahCar.jpg">Caravan of
Dreams</a></i>” has such an importance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*07</span></b>
<span class='c17'>&nbsp;It is not surprising how many
interpretations were given, and can be still given, to the Seven
Churches of the Revelation, considering the significance of the Law
of Seven. In short, this is all mathematics. In a manner of
speaking, <i>Higher Mathematics</i>, even though not the usual one
…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*08</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Even though the books
were not the only methods; it is the books which are the subject of
this article. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*09</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; “<i>handed down</i>”:
(The original comment in Russian emphasizes different shades of
meaning of this expression)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*10

<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*11</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; A special difficulty
in the work of Shah was that sometimes there was a lack of
traditional material which would be applicable at present time in
the West, and to build a necessary chain of influence he had to
compose his own parables as missing links.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*12</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; In the light of the
tasks carried out by him, during the last years of his life Idries
Shah has prepared for publication a series of <i>children’s</i>
books, containing teaching stories selected by him, and having
excellent illustrations. Some of these books have already been
published, but not all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*13</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Naturally, this
excludes the methods that could be prescribed to an individual or a
specifically selected groups by a real “seeing” teacher.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class='c28'>*14</span></b>
<span class='c17'>&nbsp;By no means all stories are intended for
discussion, especially in a random circle, on the Internet etc.
Instead of absorbing the correct impact of the story one can get
subjected to conditioning by a random, alien, incorrect (and, most
importantly, <span class="c18">unnecessary</span>) opinion. It
should be also taken into account that&nbsp; in a “wide”
discussion, besides you and “your circle”, there are others who may
not benefit from falling into dependence on interpretations
expressed by those people whom <span class='c8'>they may
consider</span> as authority, for one or another reason (for
example, because of a longer “track record” of reading or being
interested). But these are more complicated questions related to
working in groups and so on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal c2"><span class='c28'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span class=
'c28'>*15</span></b><span class='c17'>&nbsp; Yes, yes, the
objections are known (I’m like that myself!): no time to learn the
language; I understand better in Russian, I am not [very] good at
languages; boring etc, etc… But the issue can be formulated for
oneself as a question of effort and payment. Besides, one does not
have to learn the language separately, and in an academic setting.
There are accelerated methods. And one can invent a method to learn
a language through reading book(s). To sum up, given a serious
desire…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c17'>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the
Russian version of such an apparently easy to translate book as
"<i><a href="Images/Lefort.jpg">The
Teachers of Gurdjieff</a></i>" by Rafael Lefort one can find
idiotic distortions which cloud or change the meaning of the text.
And this book, in my opinion, is invaluable in its concentration of
the very aspects and principles of the Sufi work.</span></p>
